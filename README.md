# Video Games SQL & Python Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I designed and implemented an SQL database to facilitate detailed analysis of video game data. The project integrates SQL and Python to showcase how these tools work together to generate valuable insights. The main focus was on creating a robust database structure, defining relationships, and using Python for statistical analysis to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Database Structure

The database consists of five tables, each serving a specific purpose to support comprehensive analysis:
- **Games**: Contains information about various video games.
- **Players**: Stores player data, including demographics and preferences.
- **Game Prices**: Tracks the prices of games over time.
- **Countries**: Provides data on countries associated with players and games.
- **Purchased Games**: Records player purchases of games, linking players with the games they bought.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Designed the database structure and relationships.
- **Python**: Used for statistical analysis and data processing.
- **VS Code**: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding and connecting to SQL Server.
- **SQL Server**: The database management system (DBMS) used to host the database.
- **Parquet Files**: Managed large datasets efficiently using Parquet format.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to:
1. Demonstrate the integration of SQL and Python in data analysis.
2. Showcase the power of SQL for database design and data management.
3. Use Python for statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the database.
4. Provide valuable insights for decision-making in the video game industry.
